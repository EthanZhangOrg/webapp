To use this webapp, you must add BCrypt-0.3 from org.mindrot.bcrypt to the external libraries. Since it cannot be added by maven due to an unknown reason.

To set MySQL database, you should read the applications.properties in the resource filefolder. By default, there is a connection to MySQL with name "webapp". The username is "root" and the password is "Ra9Ra9".

Then just start the app and test the apis in postman!
